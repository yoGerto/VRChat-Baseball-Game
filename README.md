This repository contains all of the scripts I have been working on for a small Physics based game world in VRChat. <br />
The game world is currently in a prototype state. The core idea for this world is based on the Home-Run Contest from the Super Smash Bros. series. <br />

However, most of the core features have been implemented and have been correctly set up for networking. <br />
<br />
The scripts that are used in this project are coded in UdonSharp (or U#). <br />
UdonSharp is a compiler which turns C# code into Udon Assembly. Read more on their Website: <br />

UdonSharp has VRChat's PlayerApi built in which is useful for getting information about the players in a VRChat world instance. <br />
